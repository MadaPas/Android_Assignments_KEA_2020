My Mandatory assignments for Android-Elective at KEA (4th Semester) - 2020

```
Week 6
```
Create a "Company Business-card app" with at least 3 pages. Pick one known company as your "client". E.g. Maersk, Dong, TDC etc.
Features:
● Layout is nice and properly set up.
● Navigation between pages using buttons.
● You are free to add images, text and graphics

```
Week 7
```
Create an app called MyNotebook. 
Features:
1. A TextView where the user can type in text
2. A Save button, which saves the text to a String
3. Now create another Activity, which displays the text from 1).

```
Week 8
```
Expand on your app "MyNotebook" from previous week.
Now the first page should be a list of headlines.
Add a + button in the top right corner. When pressed, a new headline should be added to the list.
When a headline is pressed, the user should be led to a detail Activity, where the entire content is visible. And editable. Any edit should be saved in memory, when the user goes back to the list of headlines.

```
Week 9
```
Create an app "My Personal Notes" which allows the user to:
1) Create a new note
2) Save notes to Firestore
You are allowed to build upon your previous Note-app. So you only need to change the part which saves and loads, to use Firestore instead.

```
Week 10
```
Upload image from camera or photoroll to CloudStorage
Exercise: Download an image from Cloud Storage to your Android app

```
Week 11
```
Make a map. The user should be able to add new Pin with a custom text.
Extra features:
1) Save data in Firebase, so all the Pins will remain, even if the app is terminated. 
Hint: Save primitive types, and recreate Pins at startup.
2) Set mapregion dynamically, so the user's location is always in the center of the map view.
